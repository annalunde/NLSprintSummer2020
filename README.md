### Green Forecast

Green Forecast lets you see the forecasted windspeeds in some of Netlight's office areas and the predicted energy production in the same area had it been a windmill park. The wind data is gathered from [Yr](https://www.yr.no/) and the energy production is predicted using Machine Learning, using the data from Yr.

This project was done as a summersprint by three students at NTNU, with guidance from Netlight.
